# National Checklist of Taiwan

It's long since [our checklist system](http://taibnet.sinica.edu.tw/) has established in 2003. This national checklist system is the result of collaborations among taxonomists in Taiwan and has considered as the source for Taiwanese species-related projects.

The current taxonomic view is a compromise - names are imported from the Catalogue of Life project, which is a compromise itself, and attributed with domestic knowledge. Because the resulted view doesn't present subjective opinions among taxonomists, the uptake of the content hasn't been ideal, and for those who are advised to use TaiBNET name data, complaints follow.

We have initiated the revision of TaiBNET system, and are aiming at the data model at the first phase. The goal is to transform existing website into a name service that supports name retrieving, editing from either API endpoint or an UI widget, which then can be embeded into other database project so that external systems don't need to implement a nonsynchronous name component while all editing activities and updated contents can benefit all projects as quickly as possible.
